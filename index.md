# Work related to Ocean Hack Week 2018

This project contains code and data related to my participation in the [#OceanHackWeek](https://oceanhackweek.github.io/) that was held at the University of Washington in August 2018.

The hackweek was excellent, and inspired me to recreate the visualizations currently available at on the [Visual Ocean](https://explorations.visualocean.net/) website using Jupyter notebooks using Altair, and adding some functionality (such as being able to choose the time period of interest). Although this repository is designed for local use on your own machine, the notebooks are intended to be run on [Google's Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/).

Ideally, this repository will be a starting point for interested faculty and students to extend their understanding of how to plot and analyze these types of data...going from the controlled examples provided online to deeper investigation using spreadsheets, Python and beyond (JavaScript, etc).
