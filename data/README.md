# Data from Data Exploration at the [Visual Ocean](https://explorations.visualocean.net) site

This directory contains data downloaded from the OOI Visual Ocean site. These
data were originally worked up for curricula created by researchers at
Rutgers University (as detailed in their page above). The intent is not to
duplicate this data effort, but to use their data strucuture and plots as
as starting point for developing Jupyter notebook based examples.

My intent is to publish these Jupyter notebooks under a CC-BY license when
complete. (cpsarason, September 2018)
